# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The gallery feature currently works perfectly in local development but fails to update instantly in production when new gallery items are added. This creates a poor user experience where content creators add new galleries but visitors don't see the updates immediately. The system needs to implement real-time content updates that ensure gallery changes are reflected instantly across all production environments while maintaining optimal performance and SEO benefits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want new gallery items to appear instantly on the production website, so that visitors can see the latest content immediately after I publish it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new gallery item is published in Sanity THEN the production website SHALL display the new item within 5 seconds
2. WHEN an existing gallery item is updated in Sanity THEN the changes SHALL be reflected on the production website within 5 seconds
3. WHEN a gallery item is deleted in Sanity THEN it SHALL be removed from the production website within 5 seconds
4. IF the webhook fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to time-based revalidation every 30 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the most up-to-date gallery content without having to refresh the page, so that I don't miss any new photos or updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the gallery page THEN I SHALL see content that is no more than 30 seconds old
2. WHEN new content is available THEN the page SHALL update automatically without requiring a manual refresh
3. WHEN the page updates THEN my current scroll position and selected category filter SHALL be preserved
4. IF I am viewing a specific gallery detail page THEN updates to that gallery SHALL be reflected immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the gallery update system to be reliable and performant, so that it doesn't impact website performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook revalidation is triggered THEN it SHALL complete within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple gallery updates occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without creating duplicate requests
3. WHEN the system is under high load THEN gallery updates SHALL not impact the performance of other website features
4. IF webhook endpoints are unavailable THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue functioning with fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the gallery update system to be maintainable and debuggable, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook events are received THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN revalidation occurs THEN success and failure events SHALL be tracked and monitorable
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
4. IF webhook signatures are invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log security events

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to have confidence that my gallery updates will be visible to users, so that I can publish content without worrying about technical delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I publish a gallery item THEN I SHALL receive confirmation that the update has been processed
2. WHEN revalidation fails THEN I SHALL be notified through appropriate channels
3. WHEN I preview content THEN I SHALL see the same version that will be visible to public users
4. IF there are any issues with content updates THEN I SHALL have access to status information and troubleshooting guidance
